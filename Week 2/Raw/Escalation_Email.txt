Subject: CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED: Security Vulnerabilities Detected on Host 192.168.56.105(Metasploitable2)

To: Development Team

Dear Team,

I am writing to formally escalate critical security findings discovered during our recent vulnerability assessment of host 192.168.56.105.

Our scan identified that this server is currently exposing a root-level shell on Port 1524 and running a compromised version of FTP (vsftpd 2.3.4). These vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands with administrative privileges. Additionally, the phpMyAdmin interface is publicly accessible, presenting a severe risk of data exfiltration.

Proof of Concept: We verified this access by running nmap -sV -p 21,1524 192.168.56.105, which established a connection without requiring a password.

Please isolate this host from the network immediately and refer to the attached technical report for the required patch details.

Best regards,

Saurav Kumar
Security Analyst
